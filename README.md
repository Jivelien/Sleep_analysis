# Sleep analysis

### Brief introduction
the aim of this project is to recompute the sleep recording file I used during my phD and try 
to compute new analysis in a pure data driven way.

### Step
 * extract raw eeg signal from edf file
 * apply frequency analysis
   * some graph
 * cluster frequency band
 * cluster sleep phase
